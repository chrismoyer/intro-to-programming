						People have been using tools with varying levels of complexity to make math

						for logorithms. However, these technologies only went so far in that they had singular
						purposes and their scope was limited by the space they occupied, and as the Industrial
						Revolution kicked up and global trade started to expand, it became more imperative
						to get engineers and navigators the appropriate tables of equations so they could
						do their jobs well. These were difficult to reproduce accurately, and folks were
						feeling the pain. In classic infomercial style, THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER A BETTER WAY.

						gave him £1,700, which, in today's money, is roughly $200K.

					<aside class="notes">
						However, as far as the British government was concerned, human error still reigned
						in this case, as the Difference Engine ended up being trapped in development hell — the
						engine he concepted was too spendy and too complicated to produce at that time and wouldn't
						actually be built out until 1989 when it was basically done for fun by the London Science Museum
						Also to their chagrin, Babbage had gotten distracted by another project in 1837 –
						an analytical engine that could be used more broadly, had "memory", and could grapple with
						loops and conditional branching.

						Babbage's mathematical bestie was also pretty excited about this analytical

					<h1>How Do We Talk To Computers?</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Computer Program?</h3>
					<p>
						At its core, a computer program is a way of <strong class='blue'>getting something done</strong>.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Programs are everywhere... Can anyone think of an example of a program that they might have interacted with today?
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Program Examples</h3>
					<div style="float: left; width: 100%;">
						<img src="img/slide-images/program_examples2.png"  />

						<p>But how do you go from an idea to a computer program? And what IS a computer program?</p>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">

					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Computer Program</h3>
					<p>
						One of the ways to accomplish <strong class='blue'>getting something done</strong> is a list of instructions that tells the computer exactly what to do and allows interaction with human beings.

					<p>
						Those instructions have to be written in a <strong class='blue'>language</strong> that the computer can understand.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Programming Language?</h3>
					<p>
						A programming language is basically a set of strings (letters, numbers, commands) that is changed into machine code that the computer can understand.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Computer Programs</h3>
					<p>
						Computers don't understand things the same way humans do. Words and symbols that make sense to human eyes need to be translated down to <strong class='blue'>binary</strong> for the computer to understand.
					</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Binary</h3>

					<p>
						Binary is a system of expressing everything using only 1s and 0s.<br/>

					<aside class="notes">
						When digital computers actually started being made, they ultimately
						could only be spoken to electronically in a series of zeros and ones
						— binary — and telling them what to do could only really be accomplished
						by feeding them punched film or paper or manually adjusting plugs or
						switches.

						If this sounds like a pain, it’s because it was — a series of zeroes and
						ones are very far from being immediately meaningful to anyone but computers,
						who would happily chug away on them.

						The first response to machine code was assembly code. These languages

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Assembly code… looks vaguely better than a sweep of binary.
						It was more user-friendly in this respect, but a big problem with
						assembly languages is that they’re incredibly specific — in that
						they only work on a single type of computer. Which sounds like
						a bummer, but when the number of extant computers was in the
						low double-digits, there wasn't too much pressure.

						Planning ahead is key when programming. Often times programs start on a white board or with pen and paper where the programmer writes out the logic in English. Let's try another example with a cat parade. We have 4 different color of cats that are walking down the street in their own kitty parade! For each cat we're going to make a hatch mark on the cooresponding kitty color's paper. We're going to walk through this like a computer though and go top to bottom in sequential order.

								Yup. In programming languages, a single equal sign is used to assign values

								Additionally, the exclamation point in front of an equal sign is the programming
